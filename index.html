                You have now entered the world of sun lovers.
                We are a community that draw their energy from the power and beauty of the sun.
                We rise with the early hues of dawn to capture the positive energy that emanates from the first sunrise,
                and
                gratefully bid farewell to our day upon the sunset.

        <p>
            I am Lana Medawar.
            I embarked on journalism when I was a young girl who dreamed of having her own tv shows.
            I was born on the 8th of March, 1986, in a mountain city with stunning natural beauty called Jezzine.
            I pursued my passion and studied radio and tv journalism at the Lebanese University.
            Prior to my graduation in 2006, I landed my first job opportunity to work in a radio station.
            I spent six years at the station working on broadcasting news and morning shows, while working at the same
            time as a news correspondent for Arab news agencies.
            <br><br>
            2011 marked the second major career shift in my life: I joined Almayadeen news channel and worked as a major
            news anchor and program presenter.
            The third career milestone presented itself when I took on the challenging post of preparing and presenting
            a daily one hour show, Almashadiyya”, which combined politics, economics, entertainment, society and
            technology. I was also the show’s executive producer, which introduced me to whole new horizons of creative
            production work.
            <br><br>
            2021 was a monumental year. I left the world of news and political programs and decided to shift to human
            journalism!
            I began to travel and shoot episodes of the new show, “Nothing is Impossible” whose main objective was to
            inspire the audience to persist, hold firm to hope, and realize their dreams, through recounting the stories
            of people who struggled and triumphed.
            <br><br>
            My social media presence started to take a more professional pattern in 2023, when I resolved to work on
            producing a more weighty content based on books and knowledge.
            <br><br>
            That decision was one of the most pivotal career resolutions in my life that led me to found the
            Storytelling School and the Solist Mindfulness Hub.
            And the journey continues with your being part of it.
            <br><br>
            To all who know me and follow me, I send much love and gratitude; and to all who have joined recently,
            welcome!

                The Solist Readers’ Club selection for January 2026 is the novel “Rosa’s Diaries” by Reem Al Kamali.
                <br><br>
                This novel takes us to Dubai through the story of Rosa, a young girl who loves writing. Through her
                journey, we discover the history of Dubai and the UAE, while exploring her psychological and family
                challenges.
                <br>
                This month, we also read the book that created a major buzz in scientific circles: “You Are the Placebo”
                by Joe Dispenza, in which Dispenza explores the power of the mind, energy, and emotions in healing
                physical illnesses.
            </p>
